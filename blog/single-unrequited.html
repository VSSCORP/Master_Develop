                        <p class="lead drop-cap">The world is a place of love and everyone loves someone deepest to their hearts and loving someone is so harmony and when you are truly waiting for someone feeling unrequited is a bliss.</p>

                        <p>
                            I feel that when you wait for someone, you already love them and sometimes it feels like living between the lines of life, between what is happy and what is sad, between aches and the joys. It’s either a perpetual bliss or a perpetual sorrow. In finding
                            the harmony of love, I’m just playing between light and darkness. Love is the handmade thing and so it is natural to have a tendency towards a person.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: center;">

                        </p>

                        <h2>Moments</h2>

                        <p>The thing with unrequited love is we get touched without someone touching us. The cliché of every loving heart wants to get held around by arms not because it’s free or big but because it just liberates us and when you truly love
                            someone, you wouldn’t find time not talking or thinking about them. we all fear and, nobody is fearless, but when you go ahead against fear you could only end up being brave.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>All the love you’ve for someone that cannot be shared is like an unpublished story.</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>His/her eyes have a beautiful vocabulary, what a beautiful language to learn. Our hearts are museums too, they’re filled with feelings that cannot be touched but only be remembered. </p>

                        <h3>Pieces to peace</h3>

                        <p>It’s never about getting someone first or second but it is about getting the right one. You always deserve the love that you keep trying to give. So is love always a fan club with just two people. You deserve someone who doesn’t
                            ask you to stop your roar and they’re always clung to the awe of your magnitude. And they will be someone who will use their matchstick heart to magnify your flame of passion in life.</p>

                        <p>
                            We all change with the age but when we do, we’re pointed by a reason that you’ve changed and you’re not like before. But there is only a fraction who could understand that the change in you meant you’re growing. Such should not only look for what you’re
                            but for the potential of whom you can be. But we can never chase someone to fit in our world instead one must build their own. There’s always a home within where you live truly who you are, the rebellion point of unrequited
                            is to continue loving yourself no matter how many times the world asked you to change.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Loving or being loved is never easy. It’s full of chaos and torture, you would be between the lines of calmness in the chaos to the chaos in the calmness. It’s never like rain inside, it’s always a cyclone and a bigger hurricane. Everyone can sustain
                            a rain and not everyone goes upfront sailing the hurricane and when you do that you’d see a different world of a person. When you can face the storm there’s always a shelter behind. It’s never about the looks or never about
                            physique but it’s all about the person inside. The contrast of having someone is you would only crave for real but not perfect. We are all imperfections and the perfection come only when you’ve accepted and adored the imperfections
                            of your loved ones.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Imagine, the room is completely dark, you feel so lost and you would even think to move your steps. Now you lit a candle you see hope. Now you have got a bowl of water and you add a drop of color and the whole water changes its color. When you look for
                            perfections it would be only you, you’ll live with your color but when you be kind to a scar and lit a candle you could see many people in the room. I was truly inspired by a line told by the prettiest soul I met, “It’s not
                            if we look pretty but it’s being pretty kind, pretty strong and pretty funny.”
